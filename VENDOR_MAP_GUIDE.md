# Vendor Map & Location Viewing Guide

## How Vendors Can View Customer Locations

### 1. **Viewing Location on Map**

When a customer rents a product and shares their location, vendors can view it in two ways:

#### Option A: From Analytics Tab
1. Go to **Analytics** in the vendor dashboard
2. Find the rental in "Recent Rentals" section
3. If the customer shared their location, you'll see a **"View Location"** button
4. Click the button to open a detailed map view

#### Option B: From Overview Tab
1. Go to **Overview** in the vendor dashboard
2. Find the rental in the recent activity
3. Click **"View Location"** button (if location was shared)

### 2. **Map View Features**

When you click "View Location", you'll see:

✅ **Customer Information:**
- Customer name and email
- Phone number (click to call)
- Rental period dates
- Rental status

✅ **Interactive Map:**
- Customer's exact location marked on the map
- Full address details
- Street-level view

✅ **Navigation:**
- "Get Directions on Google Maps" link
- Opens Google Maps with route from your location to customer
- Perfect for product delivery/pickup

### 3. **What If Customer Didn't Share Location?**

If a customer chose not to share their location:
- You'll see "Customer did not share their location" message
- You can still see their manual delivery address
- Contact them via phone or email for directions
